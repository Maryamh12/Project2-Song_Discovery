# Song Discovery Project - README

## Introduction

This project is a web application that allows users to discover music based on their sign. Users can enter the name of their zodiac sign, and the app will fetch music related to that sign using the Deezer API. The project is built using React and React Router for navigation.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

1.  `App.jsx`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the routes and renders the header, footer, and different pages based on the URL path.
    
2.  `components/Layout/Header.jsx`: This component contains the header section of the website. It is displayed on all pages and contains links to the homepage.
    
3.  `components/Layout/Footer.jsx`: This component contains the footer section of the website. It is displayed on all pages.
    
4.  `components/HomePage/HomePage.jsx`: This component represents the homepage of the website. Users can enter their zodiac sign in the input field and click the "Search" button to discover music related to their sign.
    
5.  `components/Pages/Musics.jsx`: This component displays the music tracks related to the entered zodiac sign. It fetches data from the Deezer API based on the sign entered by the user.
    
6.  `components/Pages/Music.jsx`: This component displays details about a specific music track selected by the user. It fetches additional data from the Deezer API for the selected track.
    
7.  `App.css`, `homepage.css`, `Music.css`: CSS files for styling the respective components.
    

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    
3.  Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    
    
    
    `npm install` 
    
4.  Obtain the RapidAPI key for the Deezer API. Update the `X-RapidAPI-Key` header in both `Musics.jsx` and `Music.jsx` files with your key.
    
5.  Start the development server by running the following command:
    
    
    
    `npm start` 
    
6.  The application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
    

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

-   `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   `react-router-dom`: Library for implementing client-side routing in React applications.
-   `axios`: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine to run the project successfully.

## Important Note

1.  The project uses the Deezer API to fetch music data. Ensure that your RapidAPI key is valid and the API is working properly to get the expected results.
    
2.  While the project is functional and meets the requirements, you can further enhance it by adding additional features such as music recommendations, artist details, or user authentication.
    
3.  Always handle errors and edge cases properly to provide a smooth user experience.
